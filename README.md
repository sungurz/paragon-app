## Features

### Account & User Management

- Change password from Settings page

### Tenant Management
- Full tenant registration — NI number (masked), personal details, employment, references, apartment preferences
- Lease creation, management, and early termination workflow
- Early termination — tenant submits a request (1 month notice, 5% penalty), management approves or rejects
