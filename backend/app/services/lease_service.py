==============================
Business logic for lease lifecycle management.

Rules enforced here (not in the DB):
  - Only one ACTIVE lease per apartment at a time.
  - Early termination requires >= 30 days notice.
  - Early termination penalty = 5% of agreed_rent.
  - Apartment status is updated automatically on lease changes.
